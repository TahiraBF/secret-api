While the town of Getaria does get a good bit of tourists in peak summer time (while we were there), we didn't come across any tourists on this hike, just a few friendly locals as it's a good spot to bring dogs.",

You take a tuc-tuc from the boat and he'll have to drop you off at the top of a dirt track about 15min drive from the boat. Trust me you need to walk down the path. The first accommodation you'll see if the Klazy House on the right. Its unmissable with all the hand crafted wood features from reception desk, bar and huts. There's a shared hut and private huts but all super cheap. Ko, the owner, also has chicken running around and it super welcoming. The huts are about 5mins from the beach. ",
